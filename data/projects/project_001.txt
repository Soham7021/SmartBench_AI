Project Title: AI-Powered Customer Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

Overview:
Our company wants to build an intelligent web-based dashboard that analyzes customer feedback from multiple sources such as product reviews, Twitter posts, and support emails. The system should automatically classify customer sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral and generate real-time analytics.

Key Objectives:
1. Automate the collection and preprocessing of textual customer feedback.
2. Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to perform sentiment analysis.
3. Create a real-time dashboard showing sentiment distribution and trends.
4. Enable export of analytical reports for business decision-making.

Functional Requirements:
- Integration with Twitter API and Email API for automated data ingestion.
- Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction using NLP libraries.
- Train and deploy an ML model (Logistic Regression, LSTM, or Transformer-based).
- Store processed data and results in a scalable database.
- Interactive frontend dashboard with filters and visualization charts.

Non-functional Requirements:
- The system must handle large volumes of data efficiently.
- Cloud-based deployment with autoscaling.
- Secure user authentication and role-based access.
- Model retraining pipeline for periodic updates.

Expected Roles Required:
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Backend Developer
- Frontend Developer
- Data Engineer
- DevOps Engineer

Required Skills:
- Python, NLP, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- FastAPI / Flask for backend APIs
- React.js / Next.js for frontend
